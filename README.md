# react-native navigation demo

Introducing my straightforward React Native Expo demo repository! This project is designed to showcase a simple yet effective approach to passing props between screens in a React Native application. It is an ideal starting point for developers who want to grasp the basics of props management in a React Native and Expo environment.

Built with TypeScript, this demo emphasizes the advantages of static typing in ensuring code reliability and maintainability. TypeScript provides early error detection and improved code documentation, making development smoother and more efficient.

Key features of this demo include:

1. **React Native Expo:** This project leverages the power of Expo, a robust toolkit that simplifies React Native app development. Expo offers convenient tools for building and deploying React Native apps while providing access to native APIs.

2. **Props Passing:** Passing props between screens is a fundamental concept in React Native development. This demo provides a clear and concise demonstration of how to pass and utilize props effectively, enabling seamless communication between different components.

3. **TypeScript Integration:** The demo incorporates TypeScript into the project, demonstrating the benefits of static typing. By using TypeScript, developers can catch potential errors early in the development process and enhance the maintainability of the codebase.

4. **Simplicity:** This project is intentionally kept minimalistic to focus on the core concept of props passing. It serves as a starting point for developers who want to understand the basics without unnecessary complexities.

Whether you are new to React Native and Expo or simply looking for a straightforward example of props passing, this demo repository is a valuable resource. Dive in, explore the code, and gain a solid foundation in passing props between screens in a React Native Expo project!
